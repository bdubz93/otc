## What was your motivation?
- As a user with free time, I want to search for something to do based on my interest and be given page of results so I can do something and get off my couch.
    - I want my past search criteria to be saved to I can reference at a later time or delete past searches
- As a user with little free time, I want to have some activities randomly generated for me to chose from so I have something to do.
    - I want to have the result also stored for future reference
